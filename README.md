# SSTKareniaBrevis
Connecting Sea Surface Temperature with Karenia Brevis blooms off the West Florida Shelf. SST measurements are utilized to find the "Upwelling Index" along the West Florida Shelf. Upwelling is a phenomenon that brings cool, nutrient-rich water from depth to the surface, possibly promoting algal blooms. This semester-long project was done for Florida Gulf Coast University's Environmental Data Science course in Spring 2024.
